# Personal Hyprland Dotfiles
My personal dotfiles for use with Arch Linux and Hyprland.

## Requirements
Currently, the following packages are required to run my Hyprland setup:

- Hyprland 
- Swww (for wallpaper)
- Hyprpaper (Now obsolete)
- Dunst (for notifications)
- Waybar (for status bar)
- Wofi (for application launcher)
- Kitty (terminal)
- Nerd Fonts (for fonts)
- Neovim (for text editor)

Changable wallpapers are stored in `~/Wallpaper/`, and currently chosen one is in `~/Wallpaper/Current/` (you will need to create those dirs). You can change the wallpaper by clicking `$MainMod+Shift+R`. Colors of the system (kitty, waybar and hyprland things) are pulled from your current wallpaper

For the colors to work, you will also need to install the following packages:
- pywal/hellwal (and depending on which one you choose, you may need to create custom templates for colors)

## Current plans
1. [ ] Custom widget manager written in bash. 
2. [ ] Simple window tiling rules. 
3. [ ] GTK Themes.
4. [ ] Github widget extension.
